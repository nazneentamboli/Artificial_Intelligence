Prolog Lab Topic Sequence

1.  Prolog up and running.   Concept of Database with no assertions.
2.  Working directory

      working_directory(-X).
      change_directory('C:\\Users\\hanks\\Documents\\GitHub\\cpsc5610-fq20\\PrologLab').
  What does that tell us about how Prolog works?

2a.  Hello world.

3.  Assert by consulting a file 01.pl -- Two assertions, one a constant, one a variable.
       Consult the file
       Interesting one is bar(Z) 

4.  Socrates -- multiple answers to man(X) and of mortal(X).  Show how multiple answers work
       Also edit the file and consult it again -- add human + alive => person 
	   
4a.  Directory list problem

5.  West axioms
Notice the constants.  Use it for criminal(X) but also hostile(Z), missile(A) etc.
Show trace.

6.  04 Backtracking example.  Start with wrong notation!

7.  05 numbers
Do factorial:
factorial(X, 1) :- X =< 1.
factorial(X, Z) :- Y is X - 1, factorial(Y, Q), Z is Q * X.

Note multiple answers -- introduce the cut.

9.  Suppose we have this predicate dead (or alive for that matter) and we want to store its state in the database.
Furthermore we have "actions" kill and resurrect.

:- dynamic(dead/0).

kill :- \+dead, fail!.
kill :- asserta(dead).

resurrect :- dead, retract(dead), !.
resurrect :- fail,!.
