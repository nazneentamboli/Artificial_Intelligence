    "1.  Initial assignments -- an NxN array.  Every entry in the array must be a positive integer between 1 and N, or 0.  A positive value is the initial value for that row and column.  A zero means the (row, column) begins unassigned.  Initial assignments must respect the game rules: the same value must not appear in the same row, column, or chain\n",
    "2.  Chains -- a list of length at most N.  Each entry in the list is a list of (row, column) tuples defining a chain (a set of positions that are adjacent, and must not contain the same value. An pair (r,c) in the chains list corresponds to an index in the initial and solution array:   `initial[row][column]` \n",
